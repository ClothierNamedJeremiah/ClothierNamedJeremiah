### Hi, my name I'm Jeremiah :wave:

**I build things on the web for fun.**

I am a software engineer with a constant desire to figure out why and how things work the way they do. I enjoy building websites and teaching others along the way.

Some technologies I enjoy using: React, Redux, JavaScript, Java, and Python.

- :white_check_mark: &nbsp; I recently completed all 100 coding questions on [AlgoExpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions)</pre>
- :nerd_face: &nbsp; I'm always learning new things about ReactJS
- :books: &nbsp; I'm currently reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann
- :sushi: &nbsp; Fun fact: I love cooking and I prepare all my meals for the coming week every Sunday!
