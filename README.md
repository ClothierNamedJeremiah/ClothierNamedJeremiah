### Hi, I'm Jeremiah :wave:

I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about learning new things and helping others. I created a Google Chrome extension to help students at the University of Oregon make informed decisions when registering for courses and my latest project notifies Spotify users when new songs have been added to playlists they follow.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include: Azure, ReactJS, Java, JavaScript (ES6), and Python

- :white_check_mark: &nbsp; I recently completed all 100 coding questions on [AlgoExpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions)</pre>
- :thought_balloon: &nbsp; Ask me about my experience with [AlgoExpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/muggle-born/)
- :nerd_face: &nbsp; I'm always learning new things about ReactJS
- :books: &nbsp; I'm currently reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) by Martin Kleppmann
- :sushi: &nbsp; Fun fact: I love cooking and I prepare all my meals for the coming week every Sunday!
